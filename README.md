# subclass-dance-party

In subclass dance party, My pair partner and I were tasked with creating 3 different classes of dancers that all derived from one specific 'dancer' class. The other 'dancers' would then be some sort of variation that would make them separate and unique from the parent dancer.<br>
We used pokemon to be our dancers. <br>
This focus in this project was utilizing classes in a real application. 

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
